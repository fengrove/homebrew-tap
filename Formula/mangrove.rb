      mangrove has been installed to:
        #{prefix}

      Mangrove has installed its additional packages into:
        #{opt_pkgshare}/packages

      By default, Mangrove expects its packages to be located in ~/.swamp/packages.
      To ensure Mangrove can find these files, you have two options:

        a. Update the SWAMP_HOME environment variable:

            export SWAMP_HOME="#{opt_pkgshare}"

            You probably want to add this to your shell configuration file (~/.zshrc):

                export SWAMP_HOME="$(brew --prefix mangrove)/share/mangrove"

                or do it automatically:

                echo 'export SWAMP_HOME="$(brew --prefix mangrove)/share/mangrove"' >> ~/.zshrc

        b. Symlink the packages
           ln -s #{opt_pkgshare} ~/.swamp

      Choose the option that works best for your workflow.
